# Welcome to My Apple Music Data Exploration and Recommendation Project!
---
## What is this Pski?

This project takes your apple music data you can download at:  and uses statistics and a little math to recommend music for you to relisten to! 
I plan on taking a step further and making it recommend music you've never listened to...but baby steps first right. 

## Get Started: 
 1. clone the repo
  2. get your apple music data from:
  3. extract the proper csv and put it in the root folder of the repo
  4. run all the cells in the jupyter notebook and your're good to go!!!
